Powerful Programming Code Finder
===================================

This project was born from the need that my team and me had to sort out, store and share our code. In this retail version for GitHub, the data is stored in two JSON data files, but everything is prepared to work with any database. There are many functionalities that I have in mind to improve on this app, so I will keep implementing them in the upcoming versions. 

Briefly, the app retrieves some data (again, from JSON files, in production, from a database) and displays it in the screen, allowing to filter by category, or filter by title or category in the search bar. Clicking to the element, will show the content of the article (or code, in our case). It also has the possibility to make all the CRUD operations over every element.


How to run it
=============

    $ git clone https://github.com/tevdi/ppcf.git
    
    $ cd ppcf
    
    $ npm install
        
And then, run the project in local:

    $ npm run dev

You can see the app running in http://localhost:8080
